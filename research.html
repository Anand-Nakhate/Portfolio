                        <h3>Equity market integration in emerging economies: a network visualization approach</h3>
                        <p class="citation">Mishra, A.K., Theertha, A., Amoncar, I.M. and R L, M., <i>Journal of Economic Studies (2022)</i></p>
                        <p class="publication-description"> This study investigates network characteristics like connectivity, centrality, adjacency matrices, closeness, and betweenness indicators. The research reveals a temporal tendency in global equity markets to both integrate and segment, influenced by factors including pandemics, financial crises, global trade relations, and international investments. Employing a visualized network technique, the analysis utilizes daily closing stock market indices data from 24 countries between January 2013 and July 2020, constructing a minimum spanning tree network (MSTN) and graph network (GN). Notably, India and China emerge as pivotal global hubs among emerging economies, while India and Bangladesh function as connecting entities. Bosnia assumes a central role in the European context due to its trade affiliations. Brazil, despite experiencing recession, becomes a core cluster in Latin America. Intriguingly, African countries establish more links with the world at large rather than within the African continent. This pioneering study utilizes network models and innovative visualization strategies to delve into financial market integration within emerging nations, offering fresh insights beyond traditional correlation models' limitations.</p>

                        <h3>The Impact of Directional Global Economic Policy Uncertainty on Indian Stock Market Volatility: New Evidence. </h3>
                        <p class="citation">Mishra, A.K., Nakhate, A.T., Bagra, Y. et al., <i>Asia-Pac Financ Markets (2023)</i></p>
                        <p class="publication-description">This paper delves into the impact of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) on the Indian capital market, employing the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedastic mixed data sampling (GARCHâ€“MIDAS) methodology. Additionally, the study dissects the Global EPU (GEPU) into its constituent components using identity functions, including up, down, and composite parts, contingent on alterations in the direction of EPU and GEPU. Furthermore, it assesses the relationships among these parameters and their influence on the volatility of the Indian stock market. The empirical findings affirm a positive and significant effect of GEPU on the volatility of the Indian capital market, signifying heightened volatility during periods of elevated global economic policy uncertainty. Importantly, the study demonstrates that directional GEPU may yield distinct predictions for Indian market uncertainty under various circumstances, particularly when EPU and GEPU concurrently rise, enhancing prediction accuracy.</p>

                        <p class="citation">Mishra, A.K., Nakhate, A.T.</p>
                        <p class="publication-description">This paper evaluates the limitations of the conventional unemployment rate in gauging the welfare impact on individuals and advocates for a more comprehensive measure. It emphasizes the necessity for a metric that considers both the duration and distribution of unemployment within households. Utilizing employment experience data from diverse Indian households between 2016 and 2019, a duration-sensitive unemployment rate is computed. This novel measure improves the assessment of individuals' welfare loss due to unemployment. The study underscores the importance of incorporating household dynamics in understanding varying unemployment profiles' implications on household well-being and vulnerability. Additionally, an employment deprivation index is calculated and analyzed across regions, gender, literacy, caste, and religion, enhancing our comprehension of employment disparities.</p>

                        <p class="citation">Mishra, A.K., Nakhate, A.T., Amoncar, I.M. </p>
                        <p class="publication-description">This paper investigates the dynamic financial networks of G20 markets from 2004 to 2021, analyzing network strength, direction, and statistical significance. It explores transformations between crisis and recovery periods, identifying shock-absorbing, shock-spreading, and bridge markets. Using Granger causality tests, VAR models, and Jaccard's statistics, the study empirically assesses return spillovers and network characteristics across G20 economies, spanning events like the global financial crisis, European debt crisis, trade friction, and COVID-19 pandemic. Crises lead to increased linkages, notably during the global financial crisis and the 2020 pandemic. Developed markets exhibit greater connection stability than emerging ones. The US is a significant shock-spreader, the EU, Italy, and France act as super spreaders during the European debt crisis, while Australia and South Africa serve as shock absorbers. Emerging markets increasingly interconnect with developed economies through bridge markets or direct links. Given the G20's global trading importance, this analysis aids portfolio managers and researchers in understanding cross-border contagion flows for diversified investments.</p>

                        <h3>Foreign Portfolio Investment and Economic Dynamics: An Exploration of Emerging Economies </h3>
                        <p class="publication-description">This academic study explores equity market integration dynamics within emerging economies from 2005 to 2019, using daily closing stock market indices of 24 selected countries from January 2013 to July 2020. Employing advanced network visualization techniques, it constructs a minimum-spanning tree network to uncover intricate interrelationships. Key to the analysis is the 'closeness' metric, categorizing countries by their positions in the portfolio investment network. The study investigates the interplay between foreign portfolio investment and economic indicators across various tiers of connectivity, and it clusters countries based on these indicators. This research enhances understanding of emerging economies' relationship with foreign portfolio investments, benefiting policymakers and investors in our evolving global financial ecosystem.</p>
